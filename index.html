        <h3><a href="#" onclick="openPopup('../Web-Games/Snake/snake.html')">Snake</a></h3>
        <p>
            A classic Snake game implemented using HTML and JavaScript. This project was a great opportunity to enhance my web development skills, particularly in JavaScript. It includes features such as real-time movement, collision detection, and score tracking.

        <h3><a href="#" onclick="openPopup('../Web-Games/RockPaperScissor/rockpaperscissor.html')">Rock Paper Scissor</a></h3>
        <p>
            A Rock Paper Scissor game where the player competes against the computer. This project is currently a work in progress and aims to implement features such as random computer moves, score tracking, and an intuitive user interface.

        <h3><a href="#" onclick="openPopup('../Web-Games/Tetris/tetris.html')">Tetris</a></h3>
        <p>
            A recreation of the classic Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players control falling blocks to complete horizontal lines. The core mechanics are functional, though there is a bug with collision detection.

        <p>
            A simple sketchpad application that allows users to draw on a grid. This project was a fun way to experiment with HTML canvas and JavaScript event handling. It includes features such as color selection, grid resizing, and reset functionality.
